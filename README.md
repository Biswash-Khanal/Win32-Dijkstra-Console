# Dijkstra Shortest Path Console Application

A Windows 32-bit console application implemented in C++ demonstrating the **Dijkstra algorithm** for finding shortest paths between locations.

---

## Features

- Input locations and their distances via sample data or custom input.
- Displays shortest routes and distances between locations.
- Colorful console output for better readability.
- Audio beeps on key events.
- User-friendly menu system with help and exit options.

## Usage

Run the executable and follow the on-screen menu to:

1. Use the built-in sample dataset (Province No. 3, Nepal).  
2. Input custom locations and adjacency matrix data.  
3. View help and exit the program.

## Input Format for Custom Data

- Number of locations (N).  
- Names of the N locations.  
- NÃ—N adjacency matrix representing distances.

Example:
3
A B C
0 1 2
1 0 3
3 2 0
